# Nuit du Hack CTF Quals : keepass-300

**Category:** Inforensic
**Points:** 300
**Solves:** 6
**Description:**
Mr. Huxley has been suspected for every cybercrime we have a law for. LEA agents seized his laptop and made a copy of its RAM while the machine was still active. However, Huxley had hidden inside its laptop an EMP device that was triggered while the agents were trying to seize the hard drive. The drive got destroyed, nothing useful has been found from the RAM dump. Getting at least Huxley's passwords would be very helpful to the agents.
