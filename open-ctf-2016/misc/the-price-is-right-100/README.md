# OpenCTF : the price is right

**Category:** Tasks
**Points:** 100
**Solves:** 5
**Description:**

You may want to double-check that receipt. I think the challenge organizers may have over-charged us!
(it may be helpful to remember that all_f1@gs_l00k_liek_thiS)
(the flag is NOT all_f1@gs_l00k_liek_thiS. that's just an example of what flags look like. And the approximate length of flags)
(don't those prices look a bit weird? All of them?)
