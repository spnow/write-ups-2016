**Description:**

Our allies, the Electronic Liberation Front (ELF), recently uncovered an ancient artifact -
A weapon called the Teletronic Internal Variable Oscillator.
Well, strictly speaking, they just found the source code, not the Oscillator itself.
The blue prints seem complete, albiet grudgingly so. We can't seem to get a build working, though.
Can you take a look? This could really turn the tide against the robots
