# sCTF 2016 Q1 : rain-or-shine-35

**Category:** Forensic
**Points:** 35
**Solves:** 160
**Description:**

I've been working so hard on problems that I didn't even notice it was raining outside. I decided to take a short break and record some ambient sound for a game I've been working on, and just for fun I stuck a flag somewhere in there too! Can you find it for me?
