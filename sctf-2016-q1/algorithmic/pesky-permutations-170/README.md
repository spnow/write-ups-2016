# sCTF 2016 Q1 : pesky-permutations-170

**Category:** Algorithmic
**Points:** 170
**Solves:** 42
**Description:**

Notice: The issue with Pesky Permutations has been resolved; the flag was incorrect due to a minor bug. You should not have to run your file again, just submit your original answer.

One of my favorite pastimes is solving my [Rubik's Cube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik%27s_Cube). In fact, I've fiddled with it so much that I noticed a pattern: If you repeat the same algorithm on the cube, it will eventually return to its original state.

Can you give me the average number of permutations each algorithm in `perms.dat` takes to return the cube to solved? Round your answer to 2 decimal places and submit without `sctf{}`.

Good Luck!
