## Write-up

This one was a true recon challenge, which was heavily based
on guessing,listening to the IRC and having a ton of luck!

If you google liorogamer you find a lot of social accounts
and his (potentially) realname Liam Rahav.

There's a [twitter](https://twitter.com/liamrahav) account connected to this name...

Many teams came to this step but couldn't find anything useful here.
There wasn't anything hidden in his profile picture, neither any suspicious tweet...

The solution was hidden in his retweets. If you take the first letter of the twitterhandle of
each of his retweets you get:

    WeLcOmeTotHeJUnGlE

And you have your Flag:
    
    ABCTF{WeLcOmeTotHeJUnGlE}
