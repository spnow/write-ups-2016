Far away from earth, a few weird buddies want to send a message to their friends in earth! We managed to grab 124 [messages](https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups-2016/tree/master/asis-ctf-quals-2016/misc/broadcasting-74/Broadcasting)!! Nevertheless some noisy stuff worked against us, can you decode the message?
