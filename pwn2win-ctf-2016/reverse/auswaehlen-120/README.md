# Pwn2Win CTF : auswaehlen-120

**Category:** Reverse
**Points:** 120
**Solves:** 
**Description:**
The Club conducts a rigid and cruel training with their future agents. An exam is applied in which the student needs to stay awaken and concentrated during 72h looking to a computer screen. Everytime an asterisk appears in the screen, he needs to press the RETURN key within one second. The student doesnâ€™t know if he was able to comply with the reaction time required by the exam until the end of those 72h, increasing his anxiety and psychological pressure level. Elapsed the 72h, the student receives an approval flag if he succeeded. Otherwise, all of its vital life is absorbed by the Club leaders, producing an slow and painful death.
